#Summarize

A simple solution to summarizing articles and documents.

Currently trained on using Hillary Clinton's emails - So there is a higher weight towards political issues.

The algorithm, however, can be applied and reused on many different articles.

Currently supports summarization from URL or Raw Text data. Sentence punctuation is required.

Uses a mongoDB database to query values for each word - this database is recommended to be on the same device as the codebase. The query time will be too large if DB is on an external source.

Start a mongoDB instance out of the db folder and the program will 100% run.

Currently Supported;
Raw Text Files

Possible Implementation:
URL Article Parsing - CNN will be the test run.
